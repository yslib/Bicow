**Bicow**, an abbreviation of  the **B**est **I**mage **C**ompositor for **O**ld **W**izard. The chinese word, "老(Old)法师(Wizard)", could be simply translated into English as is, which dubs a kind of aged veteran who have an (maybe a little) expertise in photography but their tastes maybe out of date and the name stuck. Here, we just take the name for fun without discrimination.
